  <p> 
    pinocchiop, sometimes abbreviated by fans as pinop, is an INCREDIBLE
    vocaloid producer with sooo many highly successful songs and an instantly
    recognizable style !!!!  hes literally been dropping bangers as
    long as i have been alive ouuuughh, as his first song is from 2009. he usually
    makes songs with hatsune miku but has also used kagamine rin, kagamine len, and 
    kasane teto.<br>
    his tuning style has changed over the years, as in his earlier songs
    miku has a much harsher and deeper tone. now, his miku is usually very
    soft and sweet sounding! both are so beautiful and distinctively pinop!! you can 
    also usually hear his own voice in the background singing with miku, 
    a wonderful signature of his style!! AUGHH STOP I LOVE HIS MUSIC !!! 🤍
  </p>
  <p>
    for me what stands out most about pinop's songs is HIS BEAUTIFUL LYRICISM.
    THE WAY HE WRITES IS JUST SOOOO MOVING, SO MANY OF HIS SONGS JUST FILLLLLL ME 
    WITH <strong>INDESCRIBABLE</strong> EMOTION!!! but i'll do my best to describe it XD <br>   
    there's always a touch of nihilism, this feeling of hopelessness and that everything
    means nothing, that there's no use trying. self-hatred and loneliness.
    BUT THEN SOMEHOW, PEEKING THROUGH THE RUBBLE, WEAVED INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF IT,
    HOPE CANNOT HELP BUT PERSIST. I JUST GET THE SENSE 
    THAT HIS SONGS ARE OVERFLOWING WITH <strong>LOVE</strong> FOR PEOPLE
    AND THE WORLD, LIKE HE CAN ZOOM OUT TO SEE SOME GRAND BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF LIFE ON THIS EARTH THAT
    HE ILLUSTRATES IN HIS SONGS. INCLUDING ALL ITS PAIN AND LONELINESS, HE SOMEHOW STILL MANAGES TO SHOW 
    THAT WE ARE NOT REMOTELY AS ALONE OR HOPELESS AS WE THINK WE ARE, AND OVERWHELMINGLY THIS SENSE THAT 
    YOU <strong>CAN</strong> CONTINUE LIVING AND THAT EVERYTHING MIGHT JUST BE OKAY. <br>
    guys i swear his lyrics r soooooooo amazing i cried sooo much AUURGRHRHRHH AUURGRHRGRHRHHHH HH HHUUHUUUU
